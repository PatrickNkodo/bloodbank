      communities, ran by well-trained and dedicated staff and volunteers imbued with integrity, equipped with the
      necessary logistics and the maximum usage of information technology. We will continue to expand our volunteer
      network in every part of the country to ensure swift delivery of our services.</p>
    <p className="firstLetter">At present, our Red Cross provides six major services: Blood Services, Disaster Management Services,
      Safety Services, Health Services, Social Services, Red Cross Youth and Volunteer Services. All of them embody the
      fundamental principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement â€“ humanity, impartiality,
      neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity and universality. These values guide and inspire all Red Cross
      staff and volunteers, to whom being a Red Crosser is more than just a philosophy but a way of life.
